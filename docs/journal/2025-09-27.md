## 2025-09-27: Refining Data Structures and Types

### Reading WebSocket Docs and Implementing Orderbook

Managed to get the websocket client working and receiving live depth updates from Binance.

Parsed the JSON messages into a file for snapshot data to be used in unit tests for performance consistency.

Read the websocket documentation from binance to understand how to use the websocket API and maintain a local order book.

Next, I focused on refining the internal data structures to better represent the order book.

Working on the order book design, I realized that using `double` for price and quantity can lead to precision issues. To address this, I am switching to integer types with fixed-point representation.

### Next Steps
- Implement Orderbook
- Write unit tests for orderbook updates and trade generation (using the saved snapshots)
- Include performance benchmarks for orderbook updates and trade generation
