Realised that there was nothing much to test with Binance, so decided to build a simple orderbook engine that can parse generic JSON orders, maintain an order book, match trades, and benchmark performance.

I want to test the full flow aka Round Trip Time (RTT) from order submission to acknowledgment, so I modified the design to have the `processJsonMessage` function return a JSON response indicating whether a trade was executed or the order was added to the book.

I will add a Server and Client later to simulate real-world order submission and acknowledgment.

The Client will send JSON orders to the Server, which will process them and return JSON responses. This will allow me to measure the full RTT.

I would like to make it more realistic in the future and switch JSON to FIX protocol instead.
